    <h3>Episode Viewing Order</h3>
    <section>    
     <p>There is a lot of debate surrounding what the best viewing order is. This is due to the fact that the series was theatrically released in media res, or ‘in the middle’of the story.</p>
     <p>We suggest starting with Episode IV: A New Hope as a litmus test for whether or not you will enjoy Star Wars. This is because it closely follows the monomyth, or Joseph Campbell’s the hero’s journey, and woks as a self-contained story.</p>

    <h2>The Holiday Special</h2>
    <section>     
      <p>The Star Wars Holiday Special is a 97 minute television variety show that has achieved a certain cult status with fans. While the special was never officially released on video, bootleg version have been in circulation for years.</p>
      <p>George Lucas, the original creator and director for the series, famously tried (and failed) to buyall of the master copies in an attempt to make sure that the special was never broadcast again. Speaking at a convention, Lucas famously remarked, “If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every bootlegged copy of that programme and smash it.”</p>
