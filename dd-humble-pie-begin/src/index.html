					<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<p>Originally from Cornwall, chef Priya Patel moved to Canada in her teens. However, once settled in Edmonton with her family, she realized that there was nary a pasty to be found. Craving the comforts of a hot, savoury, traditional Cornish pasty, Priya got to work recreating the recipes she learned to love in her youth. </p>
					<p>Our pasties are prepared every morning in our Brewery District kitchen so that they can be served fresh from our truck. We stick to a limited menu and make a certain amount every day in order to ensure the highest quality; however, this means that once we’re sold out, we’re done for the day and shut the truck up. </p>
